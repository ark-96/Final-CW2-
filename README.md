Note – our software will not automatically read in data when opened.  When starting data can be read into the application by the ‘File’ – ‘Read Input file’ menu option. Also, although the ‘Close’ button will write output before terminating the application, it is also possible to write a file from the ‘File’ - ‘Write Report to File’ menu option.
